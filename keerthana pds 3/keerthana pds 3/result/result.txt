1)The highest value in the population exceeds that of the sample, and correspondingly, the population mean surpasses the sample mean.

2)In the context of the 98th percentile of BMI, the population's 98th percentile outweighs that of the sample.

3)When contrasting the population mean with the bootstrap mean, there exists only a marginal difference. Similarly, the disparity between the population standard deviation and the bootstrap standard deviation is minimal. Lastly, a slight variance is observed between the population percentile and the bootstrap percentile.
